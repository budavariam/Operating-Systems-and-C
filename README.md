### Content and thematic:

- More practical use of C, where a CRUD app is written by together (data storage in a file, data recording, modification, deletion, filtering)
- Forks and processes with C
- Handling of signals
- Use of pipes between processes (pipes, named pipes)
- Shared memory, Semaphores
- Tasks summarizing all previously mentioned topics, "where a given situation must be simulated”.

### Compilement: 

```gcc``` and the name of the .c file. -> default output ```a.out```
We can run it as ./a.out

Different switches:

• -o switch to specify an output file option instead of the default a.out

e.g. ```gcc arg.c -o first``` and then we can run it as ```./first```

• -Werror switch, for displaying different errors

e.g. ```gcc -Werror arg.c -o first```

• Wall switch, which checks both errors and warnings

e.g. ```gcc -Wall arc.c -o first```
